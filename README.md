## **Enabling event-based hierarchical synchronization in SDN ONOS clusters**

Abstract:
This demo presents an implementation of a resilient hierarchical synchronization system for SDN ONOS controller clusters. Two applications are designed and developed to be used respectively at child clusters and parent cluster to propagate network topology events over dedicated gRPC channels. Therefore, topological views of all the considered child domains are kept synchronized at the parent despite possible control plane failures. This work represents a novel solution specifically designed for hierarchical synchronization in ONOS clusters.
